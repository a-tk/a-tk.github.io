## Section Saw? 

What is a section saw? A section saw is usually a small saw that utilized diamond blades to cut
all kinds of material. Materials could be rocks, fossils, epoxy filled electronics and many more.
A typical saw will utilize flood coolant as well. 

I am not interested in using a section saw for any of those though, my use case will be
to cut HSS tool blanks and tungsten carbide blanks to make scraper blades, boring tools
and other things that would be useful in a machine shop. 

While the variety of material that can be cut is an advantage, one disadvantage is
that cutting speed is relatively low. 

## Design

I used to own an industrial section saw, but at 2'x3', it was just too big to keep
around my shop. When I disassembled it, I was happy to learn it was very simple inside. 
A small DC motor to power the blade, a simple gear train (actually belts), and 
basic DC speed controller was essentially all that was there. 

Taking notes from this, I designed a much smaller mechanism using scrap parts that I
have had laying around for some time. Two 15mm aluminum plates, bearings, and a 
small but powerful DC motor, but with a twist.
