## The Project

I have a logan 10" lathe that was built in 1946 and sold under the Montgomery-Ward brand. 
Well, it's most correct to say that I _had_ a logan 10" lathe.

If you didn't know, logan used the same beds on their 10, 11, and 12" swing lathes. This makes
the 10." lathe compare very favorably to comparable South-bend models of the same size. Since they aren't
as well known as South-Bend, logan models can be found more affordable too. Logan also provisioned the larger swing
lathes with a significant improvement in spindle size and geometry. The 11" lathe headstock used a 1-3/8" spindle
bore, suitable for 5C collets (compare to the 25/32" through bore of the 10" lathe).

I recently completed upgrading the carriage/apron on the old lathe to use the 
[newer automatic apron](2023-03-11-logan-apron-replacement.markdown).
Next, was upgrading the headstock.

## The New Headstock

The new headstock was purchased on eBay. I could still check most of the condition visually, for
example, that there were no missing gear teeth. Bearings where a concern, but I knew in advance
that Logan used standard deep groove ball bearings for spindle bearings.

The unit was nicely shipped in a wooden crate and received without drama.

TODO

Upon receiving the unit, I disassembled and inspected it. I was happy to see 
a hardened and ground spindle, in very good condition. The current bearings were very gummy, 
but everything else was in good working order.

## New Headstock Bearings

One primary concern with any used lathe headstock is the condition of its spindle bearings.

The topic of spindle bearings in general is beyond the scope of this blog, and convered
well elsewhere. I did however, need to purchase new ones. 

If you are familiar with Logan lathes, you know that new parts are still available for them!

In the 10" logan configuration, the front headstock bearing is a special order, internally 
preloaded double row deep groove ball bearing with locating ring. Logan specially
designed this bearing for use in their lathes so that the spindle would not require preloading
and potentially matched pairs of more expensive bearings. The downside is, these are not
available direct from any bearing vendor. They can still be purchased from Logan, although they
are very expensive.

Curiously, the 11" Logan lathe was designed to use standard single-row deep groove ball bearings for the spindle.
This is in contrast to other manufacturers of a similar time period, who used taper roller bearings or poured 
babbit.

The front headstock bearing is a 50mmx80mm bearing. Logan sells replacements for $169, which is expensive
but not astronomical. I decided to buy one diectly from Logan, because it is not clear what 
specifications the bearings are made to. 

To my surprise, an SKF Explorer arrived! Armed with this knowledge, I bought my own rear bearing for a
significant discount. Now, these are not exceptional bearings, but the headstock arrangement doesn't
permit a higher capacity bearing without modification.

## Headstock Drive

Initially, I intended to reuse the flat belt pulley arrangement. However, this comes with two significant
disadvantages:

 - A side tensioned belt drive requires significant room beside the lathe. 
 - A side tensioned belt drive pulls the lathe out of level when tensioned!

As a result, I endeavored to convert the machine to an underdrive as well.

In my shop, I had a spare 3-phase 1HP motor laying around, as well as a VFD
that I scavenged many years before. These, in combination with a direct belt drive
will run the lathe.

## Controls

In a VFD controlled machine, controls are naturally digital. Digital controls however,
contrast with the 1950's style of the lathe. I aspired to control the VFD with a lever for
selecting forward and reverse, which would be accessible from the operator position of the machine.

## The Result

First project! Spindle adapter for 5C collets.

These are commercially available, and appear on eBay frequently, but for varying amounts of money.
The commercial ones have an undesireable feature though, they protrude form the spindle by nearly 1/2".

My design will be completely located inside the spindle. This will reduce the effective diameter of the
spindle to 1-1/8" from 1-3/8", but allow me to use collets in combination with a standard lathe chuck. 
This combination enables very efficient repeatability and location or alignment in common setups.
