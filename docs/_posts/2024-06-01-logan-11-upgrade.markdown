## The Project

I have a logan 10" lathe that was built in 1946 and sold under the Montgomery-Ward brand. 
Well, it's most correct to say that I _had_ a logan 10" lathe.

If you didn't know, logan used the same beds on their 10, 11, and 12" swing lathes. This makes
the 10." lathe compare very favorably to comparable South-bend models of the same size. Since they aren't
as well known as South-Bend, logan models can be found more affordable too. Logan also provisioned the larger swing
lathes with a significant improvement in spindle size and geometry. The 11" lathe headstock used a 1-3/8" spindle
bore, suitable for 5C collets (compare to the 25/32" through bore of the 10" lathe).

I recently completed upgrading the carriage/apron on the old lathe to use the 
[newer automatic apron](2023-03-11-logan-apron-replacement.markdown).
Next, was upgrading the headstock.
