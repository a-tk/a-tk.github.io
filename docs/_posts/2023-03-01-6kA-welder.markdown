## Introduction

Since seeing Dan Gelbart's workshop series on youtube (highly recommended)
I have been interested in possessing a spot welder. 

Spot welders join thin sheet metal plates using the effect of Joule Heating. 
Joule Heating relies on the resistive properties of materials and 
the effect that passing current through them causes. Enough current creates enough heat 
to melt steel. 

Basically, the variables that effect the spot welding process are current, 
voltage, inductance, and resistance of the welder and of the workpieces. 

Lots of people make these welders using hacked microwave over transformers. 
This practice does indeed create a spot welding machine, and with sufficient
controls on the input side of the transformer, adequate welds can be formed.

The primary consideration for the success of a weld is the current flowing 
through a part. A low current can input the same energy as a high current but
in a longer period of time. Therefore, there are much higher losses due to 
heat dissipation in a long weld than a short weld. Additionally, heat gained 
in a part is due to Joule heating, which is the square of the current
multiplied by the time. Therefore, higher current results in significantly 
higher energy for the same amount of time. 

### Motivation

Which brings me to my motivation. Many MOT (Microwave Oven Transformer) Spot
Welders require passing high current through 15A 120V breakers (this is possible for short time periods), 
or do not provide enough current when run with 120V North American household
circuits.

Additionally, it seems that the MOT method lends itself to hobbyists that 
want a quick experement, not an industrial product. 

In my own shop (my garage), I only possess a North American 120V 15A circuit. 
I have also been attracted to using Super Capacitors for supplying high
current for this purpose. This has been something that was discussed several
years ago by the Applied Science youtube channel (highly recommended), but never
materialized from what I observed. 

So, I embarked on the process of designing a building a Supercapacitor based
Spot Welding Power Supply.

#### Supercapacitor? 

Wikipedia defines a Supercapacitor as "a supercapacitor (SC), also called an 
ultracapacitor, is a high-capacity capacitor, with a capacitance value much 
higher than other capacitors but with lower voltage limits" [wikipedia-supercapacitor]

The final design in this project uses a capacitor bank of 9,000 Farads charged
to 2.7V. Thats 9 Billion times more capacitance than a 1uF cap! 

## Design

At a high level, the project consists of four components: 

1. The charging circuit
2. The switching circuit
3. The timing circuit
3. The welding circuit

### The Charging Circuit

Charging 9kF of capacitance in a reasonable timeframe is not a trivial task. 

An ideal solution for this is a buck converter powers by a well designed high 
current power supply. commercial server computer power supplies are ideal for
this purpose. Luckily, I found a solution actually designed for this 
application. For this project, I use the kWeld Supercapacitor welding buck
converter found here: https://www.keenlab.de/index.php/product/ksupply/

This module reliably charges the capacitor bank at a peak 40A until full charge.

The critical factor is that the kSupply fits on readily available HP Server 
Power Supplies.

### The Switching Circuit

The Switching circuit is no doubt the most challenging aspect of a 
supercapacitor spot welder. In a traditional spot welder using a 
transformer, the switching can take place on the input side of the transformer.
That has two advantages, the first is that the current being switched can be 
many times lower than on the output side (25-50 Amps vs. thousands of amperes).
Secondly, there are many electronic components that are available for this 
purpose. A Silicon Controlled Rectifier, for instance, is a perfect fit, and
will close the switch when the AC signal crosses the 0 point. Often times, 
timing circuits take advantage of this, which is often why commercial spot 
welders specify the time of the weld in "cycles," that refers to AC cyles
across the input of the transformer. 

In a supercapacitor based welder, the switching circuit must be able
switch kiloamperes of current. It is true that there are large SCRs capable of
this, but those cannot be used because the capacitors provide a DC current, 
and require the capacitor bank to empty before the switch would close.

This design uses a parallel configuration of 25 power mosfets, each capable 
of pulsing 300A. Its actually incredible what modern electronics are capable
of. After a lot of prototyping, I chose the PSMN1R0-30YLDX FET for this. Importantly,
this mosfet is stocked in JLCPCBs library, and cost about $1 each. 

As you might be able to tell, I can then simply order PCBs for the welder
from JLCPCB fully assembled for about $30 each. Again, its amazing that 
a solid state switch capable of conducting more than 6kA can be had for that
price. 

### The Timing Circuit

For the timing circuit, I chose to implement an analog monostable multivibrator
using a 555 timer and a decade switch. Not only is this reliable, its 
extremely inexpensive and can also be assembled on the same board from 
JLCPCB. 

### The Welding Circuit

The welding circuit consisted of all the aforementioned components, simply 
assembled together, plus a lot of copper. As you might imagine, the copper was
the most expensive component of the BOM.

Here are the main components:

    3x Maxwell 2.7V 3000F Capacitors
    2x HP Server Power Supplies 
    1x kSupply buck converter
    1x spot welding switch and timing board
    A Lot of Copper
    1x small Miyachi spot welding head, with custom electrodes
    1x array of TVS diodes
    Various buttons, switches, a current shunt, and panel gauges

## Construction

I decided to manufacture as much of the welder that I could. Here is a photo 
montage of the process.

## Assembly

After everything was built, cleaned up and painted, it was time
for final assembly. Yes, I did use the spot welder to weld the 
nuts to the frame for assembly.

## Results

Here are a few pictures of two simple box projects made with the welder, 
as well as a weld through several pieces of 22Ga steel to demonstrate its
capabilitity.
