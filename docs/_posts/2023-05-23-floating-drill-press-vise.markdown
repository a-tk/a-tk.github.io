## The Floating Drill Press Vise

Methods for securing drill presses to their tables have existed since
the invention of the machine.

They each come with a variety of advantages and disadvantages. 

In my shop, the drill press is valued largely for its ease of 
setup and convenient use. I have gotten along without using hold downs
on the vise for sometime, as they mostly compromise those factors too much for
my comfort. 

I was recently inspired to build a holding system out of some scrap I had
in the junk bin by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URrcT4CN5Qo).

The design is hardly utilitarian enough for my taste though, and requires
some tools that I don't have (such as a rotary table). The rod clamping pocket
also appears to be very time consuming to custom-fit and difficult to machine. 

Instead, I chose to build a version of this from a 1" aluminum plate, 
with a hole, and a single cut for a flexture clamp.

Instead of using a challenging pocket to clamp the floating rod, this design
uses a simple block that is fit to the front of the clamping ring.

### Testing

I chose about the hardest test by drill press will face to determine if this would work well. 

Clamping an uneven, sawcut workpiece in the vise, and drilling through it with a 1/2" 
drill without a center. 

It worked like a charm! 

Overall, I am very happy with the build and the result.
