## The 2023 Project List
Each and every year,  I like to keep a list of projects that I would like to work on. 

For one, it helps me keep track of progress, but also keeps thoughts aligned and is a nice
dumping ground for the wild hair projects I get when I often can't sleep.

## The list

### Machine Tool Projects
