## Unitron TMS

The following are some photos of the Unitron TMS microscope.

This microscope is made of a cast iron body and designed for metallurgy, toolmaking,
biology, inspection, and many other applications. There are a wide variety of
attachments which allow the accurate measurement of distances and angles. 

This particular model is equipped with: 

 - 1" x 1" travel stage
 - binocular eyepiece
 - monocular eyepiece
 - filar eyepiece
 - 3X, 5X, 10X, 50X and 100X objectives

These allow measurements in 3 dimensions at resolution of 0.0001" (greater with filar attachment).
The microscope weighs just over 40lbs! The vertical column is handscraped for accuracy.

The handscraped ways of the vertical column are a feature a bygone age in manufacturing.

The base hides the electrics for dimming each lamp. To do so, the provided mains power is reduced
with auto-transformers for two outlets.

The X-Y stage is constructed of bronze and spring preloaded. The stage has been shimmed for level.

An apparent cost-saving measure is the construction of the slideways. Each V way is composed
of soft material, with hardened steel inserts at the areas of ball bearing contact.

The microscope can be used in many different applications. My favorite is as a profile projector!
