I own a 1946 10" Logan Lathe. It is one of the lathes that Logan
manufactured which was resold by Montogomery-Ward. 

The machine came to me from a farmer in rural Idaho.

If you aren't familiar with lathes or their components, I suggest
reading about them [here.](https://www.americanmachinetools.com/lathe_diagram.htm)

Additionally, the lathes.co.uk site has a nice section on Logan and
the accessories available on their lathes.
