I have a fascination with esoteric multimeters, which is particularly attracted to late 70's
and early 80's scopes that used Nixie tube and Panaplex tube displays. 

In my small but respectable collection, I have a Fluke 8200A that works well. 

This is a 4 1/2 digit meter that uses Nixies for its display.

## The Problem

Recently, I needed to leave the scope powered on for about one hour, and when I returned
the Nixie display was completely dim. 

Cycling the meter revealed that the display would turn on briefly, and continue getting dimmer
and dimmer until it appeared off. 

If you don't know, Nixie tubes (and other tube based displays) require about 200VDC to power the tubes.

This means that they require a digital logic board to do the digital conversion which is tolerant
of the high voltages, as well as a 200VDC power supply.

## Investigation

Immediately suspect is the power supply. The power supply board on this meter is pretty simple.
It takes 3 AC lines from a transformer as input and runs a simple linear regulator for each output 
(5VDC, 15 and -15VDC, and 200VDC). Fluke nicely has a set of test points for each one, and a 
troubleshooting for each rail. 

Of course, the 200VDC rail is the important one here, but first I inspected the board overall.

I was immediately drawn to the discoloration at the diode rectifier arrays. 

Closer inspection revealed that those are the diodes for the 15V/-15V rails. I also verified that 
they weren't getting hot with the board at idle, and left them as is. The board has signs of previous
repair (the electrolytic filter caps near the input) and the orange cap in the middle of the board. 
Perhaps that was an old problem, and not immediately relevant to this new issue. 

I then followed the manual's inspection procedure for the 200V rail, and observed it
outputting 140V, which is consistent with the dim display.

According to the schematic, there isn't much between the rectifiers and the output that can
affect the 200V rail. First, is the 8uF filter cap on the output. This is the orange cap
in the middle of the board. This was easily confirmed to be acceptable by using an oscilloscope 
to validate the ripple on the cap under power, as well as the voltage. Both were okay, and
just to make sure I removed the cap to check its ESR. At about 5 ohms for this HV cap, 
that also was okay. 

Next, was to check the active components of the voltage regulator.

This is a very clever regulator. I would have expected to see a Zener diode in here, or
in a more modern design an LM78xx family 3 terminal regulator (although I don't know if those are available
such high voltages).

It appears that Q1 conducts when C1 gets enough charge, and Q1 sets a voltage to the base of Q2 based on the resistor
divider network R3 and R4.
