I own a 1946 10" Logan Lathe. It is one of the lathes that Logan
manufactured which was resold by Montogomery-Ward. 

The machine came to me from a farmer in rural Idaho.

If you aren't familiar with lathes or their components, I suggest
reading about them [here.](https://www.americanmachinetools.com/lathe_diagram.htm)

Additionally, the lathes.co.uk site has a nice section on Logan and
the accessories available on their lathes. 

[Logan Lathes](http://www.lathes.co.uk/logan/index.html)

## Background

This lathe came with what Logan called their "" apron.

The "" apron can provide power cross-feed and power-longitudinal feeds. 

Power longitudinal-feed is provided by half-nuts and quick change gears. 
half-nut engagement is how single-point threads are formed. 

Power cross-feed is driven by a keyway in the leadscrew. This keyway interacts
with a pair of miter gears which can drive a spur gear on the cross-slide leadscrew. 

My lathe is equiped with a Logan Quick Change Gearbox (QCGB). The gearbox didn't come with the lathe, 
it was installed afterwards. This will also get a partial rebuild during this project. 

### Problems

This setup is a good one in general, especially for a hobby lathe. However, there
are a few general problems with it:

  1. Typical longitudinal power feeds require different change gears than typical 
      thread pitches. Even the QCGB doesn't eliminate change gear muddling. 
  2. No safety mechanism for longitudinal power feeds if the lathe is crashed.
      If crashed, something will break, likely the hih torque carrying QCGB spur gears.
  3. Longitudinal power feeds will wear both the leadscrew and the half-nuts. 

These would inevitably prevent me from ever using longitudinal power feeds. Most
of my shop time is time-constrained, and extra time spent switching change gears
cuts into that. 

#### Notes on QCGB feeds

In case it cannot be found elsewhere on the internet, a Logan QCGB in the standard
threading configuration can supply down to 224TPI, or feeds of ~0.0045" per revolution.

### Solutions

To solve these problems, and to create an interesting project, I decided to replace
the standard apron on this lathe with what Logan calls their "Automatic Apron."

The automatic apron features a friction clutch and additional gear reduction to power both
power longitudinal feeds and power cross feeds. The friction clutch is designed to sit in
an oil bath as well. Power feeds for both axes are driven from the keyway in the leadscrew,
thus eliminating use of the leadscrew thread and halfnuts. 

#### Notes on the Automatic Apron Conversion

This is not an orginal project. Logan used the same bed casting for many of its lathes. 
Because of this, many parts are interchangeable, between even 10" and 11" swing lathes. 

Although people have done the conversion before, many details are not available to the public.

Here are some quick notes:
  1. The automatic apron requires a saddle that will fit. Standard apron saddles WILL NOT work.
  2. Many eBay listing are for either the saddle or apron, but not both. Identifying
      an automatic apron compatible saddle is easy, look for the distance between screws which
      mount the underside saddle gib. If they are close together (almost touching the
      cross slide ways) it will NOT fit the automatic apron.
  3. The automatic apron requires that the leadscrew be moved away from the bed by a certain
      amount. Check the tables below to see the dimensions that I used. 

I found that the automatic apron power feed gear reduction is 1/3 the QCGB setting for 
longitudinal feeds, and 1/10 the QCGB setting for cross-feeds.  

## The Plan

  1. Purchase suitible automatic apron and saddle
  2. Clean, inspect and identify repairs
  3. Conduct repairs, if any
  4. Fit saddle to lathe bed
  5. Fit apron to lathe bed
  6. Fit leadscrew to apron
  7. (not initially planned) refurbish QCGB

## The Work

The work section is organized by component, not chronologically.

### Apron

The apron was purchased from eBay. It seems that there are still (as of 2022) quite a few
sellers that are parting out Logan lathes. I purchased an apron that looked okay
where it counted (worm gear threads were okay, no mechanical damge visible).
However, the apron was extremely dirty and packed with chips and dried oil
and multiple coats of paint. 

#### Apron Cleanup

Cleaning was a matter of complete disassembly, removing grime, removing old paint,
and degreasing.

This process revealed a few worn components. 

#### Apron Worm Gear Bushings

The (original?) worm gear busing where worn roughly 0.015" diametrically. 

This was unnacceptable, so I made a replacement pair to fit the worm gear.

The worm gear has two bearing surfaces, not including the work itself. 
Each bearing surface was worn differently, but fortunately, cylindrically.

I made two new bronze replacements for the worm gear holders. 

#### Apron Drive Pinion Replacement

The apron also came with a worn pinion gear that drives
the carriage across a lathe bed. I chose to repair this. 

This is the first in many gear related problems for the Logan lathe. 

Don't be discouraged, most gears are readily available as of 2022! 

This is a 16T 16 Pitch stem pinion. There are no replacement stem pinion available
commercially and for low price that will fit here. 

The economical choice is a replacement spur gear fit to the oriinal shaft.

### Saddle

#### Saddle Damage

#### Saddle Measurements

#### Saddle Machining

#### Saddle Scraping

### Leadscrew & QCGB Fit

#### Leadscrew First Fit

#### Leadscrew Straightening

#### Leadscrew Tailstock-Side Wear Repair

### Quick Change Gear Box

#### Gear Select Lever Crack Repair

#### 'e' (16T) Gear Replacement

#### 22T Gear Replacements

#### 40T Gear Replacements

#### Gear Re-bush

#### New shafts

#### Main Shaft Oil Port

## Assembly and Test

### Lubrication

#### Quick Change Gearbox Lubrication

#### Apron Lubrication

All components where coated in way oil during final assembly. The two shells of the apron
also recieved a silicone gasket to prevent a leaking oil bath. 

The change gears in the arpon were coated with a small amount of Shell 
Rotella SD Special Duty Moly Grease. 

The friction clutch oil bath was filled with #2 way oil. 

### Test

Testing went very well! Since no one on the internet seems to publish specifications for cuts, 
here is a table.
