I own a 1946 10" Logan Lathe. It is one of the lathes that Logan
manufactured which was resold by Montogomery-Ward. 

The machine came to me from a farmer in rural Idaho.

If you aren't familiar with lathes or their components, I suggest
reading about them [here.](https://www.americanmachinetools.com/lathe_diagram.htm)

Additionally, the lathes.co.uk site has a nice section on Logan and
the accessories available on their lathes.

## Background

This lathe came with what Logan called their "" apron.

The "" apron can provide power cross-feed and power-longitudinal feeds. 

Power longitudinal-feed is provided by half-nuts and quick change gears. 
half-nut engagement is how single-point threads are formed. 

Power cross-feed is driven by a keyway in the leadscrew. This keyway interacts
with a pair of miter gears which can drive a spur gear on the cross-slide leadscrew. 

My lathe is equiped with a Logan Quick Change Gearbox (QCGB). The gearbox didn't come with the lathe, 
it was installed afterwards. This will also get a partial rebuild during this project. 

### Problems

This setup is a good one in general, especially for a hobby lathe. However, there
are a few general problems with it:

  1. Typical longitudinal power feeds require different change gears than typical 
      thread pitches. Even the QCGB doesn't eliminate change gear muddling. 
  2. No safety mechanism for longitudinal power feeds if the lathe is crashed.
      If crashed, something will break, likely the hih torque carrying QCGB spur gears.
  3. Longitudinal power feeds will wear both the leadscrew and the half-nuts. 

These would inevitably prevent me from ever using longitudinal power feeds. Most
of my shop time is time-constrained, and extra time spent switching change gears
cuts into that. 

#### Notes on QCGB feeds

In case it cannot be found elsewhere on the internet, a Logan QCGB in the standard
threading configuration can supply down to 224TPI, or feeds of ~0.0045" per revolution.

### Solutions

To solve these problems, and to create an interesting project, I decided to replace
the standard apron on this lathe with what Logan calls their "Automatic Apron."

The automatic apron features a friction clutch and additional gear reduction to power both
power longitudinal feeds and power cross feeds. The friction clutch is designed to sit in
an oil bath as well. Power feeds for both axes are driven from the keyway in the leadscrew,
thus eliminating use of the leadscrew thread and halfnuts. 

#### Notes on the Automatic Apron Conversion

This is not an orginal project. Logan used the same bed casting for many of its lathes. 
Because of this, many parts are interchangeable, between even 10" and 11" swing lathes. 

Although people have done the conversion before, many details are not available to the public.

Here are some quick notes:
  1. The automatic apron requires a saddle that will fit. Standard apron saddles WILL NOT work.
  2. Many eBay listing are for either the saddle or apron, but not both. Identifying
      an automatic apron compatible saddle is easy, look for the distance between screws which
      mount the underside saddle gib. If they are close together (almost touching the
      cross slide ways) it will NOT fit the automatic apron.
  3. The automatic apron requires that the leadscrew be moved away from the bed by a certain
      amount. Check the tables below to see the dimensions that I used. 

I found that the automatic apron power feed gear reduction is 1/3 the QCGB setting for 
longitudinal feeds, and 1/10 the QCGB setting for cross-feeds.  

## The Plan

  1. Purchase suitible automatic apron and saddle
  2. Clean, inspect and identify repairs
  3. Conduct repairs, if any
  4. Fit saddle to lathe bed
  5. Fit apron to lathe bed
  6. Fit leadscrew to apron
  7. (not initially planned) refurbish QCGB
