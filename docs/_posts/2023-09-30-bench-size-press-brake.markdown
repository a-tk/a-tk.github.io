## The Project

Small press brakes are the thing of fantasy for hobby machinists. Of course, there are small 
3-in-one combination machines that can be imported for not much money. For bending sheet metal
though, they fall short in capacity for steel. 

I'm going to design and build a small press brake that is light enough to move around, and can
reliably bend thicker steels to 90 degrees.
