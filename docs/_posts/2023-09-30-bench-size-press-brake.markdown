## The Project

Small press brakes are the thing of fantasy for hobby machinists. Of course, there are small 
3-in-1 combination machines that can be imported for not much money, which seem to
work fairly well.

I designed and built a small press brake that is light enough to move around, and can
bend 16Ga steel.

These bearings are cast iron.

Horizontal milling finds good application here.

If I were to rebuild this, it would be better faster to insert 0.75"
dowel pins into the eccentric. A hardened bearing surface would come as a bonus.
