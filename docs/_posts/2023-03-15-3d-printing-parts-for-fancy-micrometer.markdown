## The Digit Mike

Brown and Sharpe Digit Mike's are beautiful, Swiss-made micrometers with
a fully mechanical digital display which direct reads to 0.0002."

Unfortunately, there is a systemic manufacturing problem with a cylindrical
plastic key on the spindle. These are almost always cracked. 

Try searching for Digit Mike on eBay, and you'll see what I mean. 

## Project

My goal for this project was to 3D print a replacement key for this part, and 
to make the part and the design available for anyone else that wanted to 
do the same. 

MSLA is the perfect 3D printing technology for this application, combining
high resolution with accuracy to reproduce the geometry of the part. 

Simply machining a replacement isn't easily done because of two internal
keys.
