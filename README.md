My name is Andre, and I am from Idaho. Outside of my professional life, I 
enjoy projects that are esoteric in nature. Namely, restoring old machine tools 
(like my 1946 Logan Lathe), 
using analog electronics and then building things with them. I also enjoy the 
Idaho outdoors, hiking, exploring and breathing the fresh air.
